# center-line package

Scrolls the cursor to the center of the screen.  Repeat to cycle between the center, top, and
bottom of the screen.

This is similar to the built-in Editor:Scroll To Cursor but adds the support for scrolling to
the top and bottom.  Also, as of Atom 0.84, Editor:Scroll To Cursor does not scroll the cursor
to the center of the screen if the cursor is already visible.
